This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP when modifying an array while iterating over it using a foreach loop.  The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, which can lead to unexpected results due to the shifting of array indices.  The `bugSolution.php` file presents a more robust solution using `array_filter` to avoid this issue. This pattern can lead to subtle and difficult-to-debug errors in applications.  Please refer to the files for detailed examples and explanations.
